# CDUT-Road
In order to enrich and improve the semantic segmentation datasets of Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds for urban road scenes, a dataset called CDUT-Road is constructed for campus and surrounding road scenes. The original data of this dataset is obtained using the MLS system and contains a total of 370 million points. It defines 13 semantic categories, including Fence, Road-isolation-structure, Pole, Traffic-sign, Sign, other, Car, Non- vehicle, People, Road, Other-road, Building, and Vegetation. The dataset is first manually annotated using CloudCompare software, and the annotated results are approximately evenly divided into 52 scenarios. The dataset is then randomly split into training, validation, and testing sets in a ratio of 6:2:2. Based on this dataset, three representative deep learning models, PointNet++, BAAF-Net, and RandLA-Net, are trained, tested, and evaluated, providing a reference for related research.
